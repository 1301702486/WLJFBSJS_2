a)Use the circuit-switched network will be better, becasue the application involves long sessions with predictable smooth bandwidth requirements.We already know the transmisson rate which is not brusty, bandwith can be reserved for each application session without significant waste. In addition, the overhead costs of setting up and tearing down connections are amortized over the lengthy duration of a typical application session.

b)In the worst case, all the applications simutaneously transmit over network links.However, since one link has enough bandwidth to handle all of the application's data rates.So ,in this situation, the network does not need congestion control mechanisms.

# P6
a)d<sub>prop</sub> = m/s

b)d<sub>trans</sub> = L/R

c)d<sub>end2end</sub> = m/s+L/R

d)The bit is just leaving A

e)In the link not in B, the distance is s*d<sub>trans</sub>

f)In B

g) m = (L/R)*s= 536KM


# P12
The arriving packet must first wait for the link to transmit 4.5*1500 bytes = 6750 bytes. Since these bits are transimitted at 2Mbps, the queuing delay is 27msec. Generally, the queuing delay is (nL+(L-x))/R
