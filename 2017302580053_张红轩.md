## 1.P6

(a)  Propagation delay is : d<sub>prop</sub> = m/s

(b) Transmission time is: d<sub>trans</sub> = L/R

(c) The end to end delay is d = d<sub>prop</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub> = m/s+L/R

(d) when time t = d<sub>trans</sub> , the last bit of the packet is at A.

(e) if d<sub>prop</sub> > d<sub>trans</sub> , at time  t = d<sub>trans</sub> , the first bit is in propagation.

(f) if d<sub>prop</sub> < d<sub>trans</sub> , at time  t = d<sub>trans</sub> , the first bit is at B

(g)  Suppose d<sub>prop</sub> = d<sub>trans</sub>,

​		which should have m = (L\*s)/R = 120\*2.5\*10<sup>8</sup> / 56k = 5.36\*10<sup>5</sup> (m) = 536(km)

​		So when m = 536km,  d<sub>prop</sub> = d<sub>trans</sub>

## 2.P8

(a) n = 3M/150k = 20, so when use circuit switching,  it can support 20 users

(b) This question 's correspond answer is in (c) and (d)

(c) Suppose exactly n users are transmitting simultaneously, Let N=n: 
$$
P(N=n) =  C_{120}^n * (10\%)^n * (1-10\%)^{120-n}
$$
(d) Assume the probability that there are 21 or more users transmitting simultaneously is P<sub>2</sub>
$$
P_2 = 1 - \sum_{n=1}^{20}{P(N=n)}
$$

## 3. P13

(a) let d<sub>queue_n</sub> is the queuing delay of n<sup>th</sup> packet which can be sent from the link,

​	clearly d<sub>queue_1</sub> = 0, and 
$$
d_{queue\_2} = \frac {L}{R}
$$

$$
d_{queue\_n}=(n-1)\frac {L}{R}
$$

for that, the average queuing delay for the N packets is:
$$
d_{avg}=\frac {1}{N} * \sum_{n=1}^{N} d_{queue\_n} = 0 + \frac {L}{R} + ... + (N-1) * \frac {L}{R}  = \frac {N-1}{2}*  \frac {L}{R}
$$
(b)

Since N packets can be transmitted in 
$$
\frac {LN}{R} seconds,
$$
so,  link has no packet need to transfer at the time each N packets arrive.  

According to the answer of (a) , average queuing delay of a packet is :
$$
\ d_{avg}=\frac {N-1}{2}*\frac {L}{R}
$$
