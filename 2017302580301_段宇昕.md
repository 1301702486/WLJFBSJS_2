# P7
Before A can transmit the first bit, the entire package must be converted from analog signal.  
The delay of conversion is:  
![56(byte)*8(bit/byte)/64 *10^3(bit/sec) = 7ms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DYnamoX513/markdown-photots/master/compute%20network/Ch1/P7/gif.gif)  
The time spent on transmitting is:    
![0.224ms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DYnamoX513/markdown-photots/master/compute%20network/Ch1/P7/gif%20(1).gif)  
The propagation delay is   
![10ms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DYnamoX513/markdown-photots/master/compute%20network/Ch1/P7/gif%20(2).gif)   
The total time elapsed until the bit is decoded is  
![17.224ms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DYnamoX513/markdown-photots/master/compute%20network/Ch1/P7/gif%20(3).gif)

## a
When using circuit switching, the maximum number of users is  
![10000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DYnamoX513/markdown-photots/master/compute%20network/Ch1/P9/gif.gif)  
## b
The possibility that more than N users are sending data is

If we suppose that a = 100 pkt/s (I=ax<1), the function shows like this

As x increases, which means the route is taking more time to transmit a packet, the total delay increases rapidly.  
Finally, when x is close to 1/a, the delay tends to be infinity

## P15
transmit μ packets per second = use 1/μ sec to transmit one = L/R = 1/μ
