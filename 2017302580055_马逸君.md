## Homework 2

### Randomly choose 3 problems to solve

**P6.** 

a. d_prop = m/s

b. d_trans = L/R

c. d_total = d_prop + d_trans = m/s + L/R

d. The last bit is exactly at the endpoint of the link between A and B, which is the end near host A.

e. The first bit is in the link between A and B, still in propagation.

f. The first bit has already arrived at host B.

g. According to d_prop = m/s, d_trans = L/R, we have m/(2.5 * 10^8) = 120/(56 * 10^3), so m = 5.36 * 10^5 m = 536 km.

**P8.**

a. The system can support 3 * 10^6/(150*10^3) = 20 users.

I don't think the question b is a question. 

c. ![expr1](https://github.com/antman9914/CitiChatbot/blob/master/hw2f1.png?raw=true)

d. We can find out that 

![expr2](https://github.com/antman9914/CitiChatbot/blob/master/hw2f2.png?raw=true)

and by using MATLAB, we can figure out that the result is 0.0079

**P13**

a. d_avg = (0 + (n-1)L/R)/2 = (n-1)L/2R

b. Since every N packets need LN/R seconds to be transmitted, so there will be no data interference among the transmission process of every N packets. So the average queueing delay is still
 d_avg = (n-1)L/2R
