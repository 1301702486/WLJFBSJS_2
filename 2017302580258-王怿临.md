**a.** The time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the highway is (10 cars)/(5 cars/minute)=2  minutes. The time required for a car to travel from the exit of one tollbooth to the next tollbooth is 150 km/(100 km/hour)=1.5 hours=90 minutes. Since the cars should , the total time should be 2&times;3+90&times;2 =186 minutes

**b.** (8 cars)/(5 cars/minute)=1.6 minutes. The total time should be 1.6&times;3+90&times;2 =184.8 minutes

**a.** d<sub>end-end</sub> = &sum;<sub>1</sub><sup style="margin-left:-7px">N</sup> (d<sub>proc</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub> + d<sub>prop</sub>)

**b.** total queuing delay = N &times; d<sub>queue</sub>, so d<sub>end-end</sub> = &sum;<sub>1</sub><sup style="margin-left:-7px">N</sup> (d<sub>proc</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub> + d<sub>prop</sub>) + N &times; d<sub>queue</sub>

**P23**

**a.** time = L / min{R<sub>s</sub>, R<sub>c</sub>} =  L / R<sub>s</sub>

**b.** It is possible. Since R<sub>s</sub> < R<sub>c</sub>, this time the router will not be able to forward bits as quickly as it receives them. When the second link arrives, the second input queue is still delivering the first link, then the second packet queues.

T at least = L / (R<sub>c</sub> - R<sub>s</sub>)
