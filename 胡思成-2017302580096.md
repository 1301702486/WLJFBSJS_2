# Assignment 2
### p2
Within the time N*(L/R),the 1st data packet has arrived. And the 2nd is stored at the last router... Within the time N(L/R)+L/R, the 2nd has arrived. So we can get the conclusion, within the time N(L/R)+(P-1)(L/R), that is (N+P-1)*(L/R), all data will arrive.

### p7
Consider 1 packet and think about the 1st bit. Before a packet can be tranfered, the bits generated time should be:56*8/64000=7ms. Then the time needed to transfer the packet is: 56*8/2M=224us. 

The propagation delay is 10ms; So we can get the total time is: 7ms+224us+10ms=17.224ms;
### p9 
a. 1G/100k=10000

b.according to the meaning of the question, the answer is:
