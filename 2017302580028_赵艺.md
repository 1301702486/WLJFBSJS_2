### P3
a. A circuit-switched network would be more appropriate for this application. 
Because this application will continue running for a long period of time at a steady rate.
In this case, the channel capacity won't be wasted and the circuit-switched network can transmit data faster and more stable.

b. No, because the sum of the application data rates is less than the capacities of each and every link. There won't be any congestion.

### P7
time = 56 * 8 bits / 64 kbps + 56 * 8 bits / 2 Mbps + 10 msec 
     = 7 msec + 0.224 msec + 10 msec
     = 17.224 msec

So 17.224 msec elapses from the time a bit is created until the bit is decoded.

### P12
To transmit one packet, we need **t = 1500 * 8 bits / 2 Mbps = 6 msec**.

There are four and a half packets to be transmitted, so we need **4.5*t = 27 msec**.

More generally, **queuing_delay_time = [(n + 1) * L - x] / R**.
