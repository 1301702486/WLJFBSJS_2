﻿# Assignment 2### p2(N+P-1)*(L/R)The 1st data packet: N*(L/R); the 2nd:  N(L/R)+L/R. So when an other data packet arrives, another L/R is needed.### p756 * 8 bits / 64 kbps + 56 * 8 bits / 2 Mbps + 10 msec      = 7 msec + 0.224 msec + 10 msec= 17.224 msecSo 17.224 msec  elapses from the time a bit is created( from the original analog signal at Host A) until the bit is decoded (as part of the analog signal at Host B).### p12(N−1)L/2RThe 1st packet: 0 queuing delay; the 2nd packet: L/R queuing delay; the  last packet: (N−1)L/R.So the total queuing delay: N(N−1)L/2Rthe average queuing delay:(N−1)L/2R
