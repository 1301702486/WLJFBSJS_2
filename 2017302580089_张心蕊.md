### P6

a. d_prop=m/s

b.d_trans=L/R

c.d=d_drop+d_trans=m/s+L/R

d. It has just left from A.

e. It is on the way to B.

f. It has just arrived at B.

g. d_pro}=m/s=L/R=d_trans

​	m=Ls/R=5.36*10^5  m

### P13

a. 

​	First: 0

​	Second: L/R

​	Third: 2L/R

​	Nth: (N-1)/R

=>d_average=(L/R+2L/R+…+(N-1)L/R)/N==(N-1)L/2R

b.

​	d_averag=(N-1)L/2R

### P22

Let the probability of successfully receiving a packet = 1-p

For n routers:

​	p_s=(1-p)^N

The average number of re-transmissions needed=1/p_s -1
