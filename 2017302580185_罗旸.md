a) 
$$
d_{prop}=m/s\quad seconds
$$


b) 
$$
d_{trans}=L/R \quad seconds
$$


c) 
$$
d_{end-to-end}=(m/s+L/R)\quad seconds
$$


d) The bit is just leaving Host A.

e) The first bit is in the link and has not reached Host B.

f) The first bit has reached Host B.

g) Want
$$
m=\frac{L}{R}s=\frac{120}{56*10^{3}}(2.5*10^{8})=536km
$$


**P7**

Consider the first bit in a packet. Before this bit can be transmitted, all of the bits in the packet must be generated. This requires

(56*8 bits)/(64kps) sec=7 msec. 

The time required to transmit the packet is

 (56*8 bits)/(2Mbps) sec=0.224 msec. 

Propagation delay = 10 msec. The delay until decoding is

7 msec +0.224 msec + 10msec = 17.224msec

A similar analysis shows that all bits experience a delay of 17.224 msec.

a.The queuing delay of the first group is 0, the second is L/R, the third is 2L/R, and the nth is (n-1)L/R. Therefore, the average queue delay is (L/R + 2L/R + â€¦ + (N-1)L/R) / N = (N-1)L/2R

b.It takes *LN* / *R* seconds to transmit the *N* packets. Thus, the buffer is empty when a each batch of *N* packets arrive. Thus, the average delay of a packet across all batches is the average delay within one batch, which equals to (*N-*1)*L*/*2R*.
