P2 
  When N*(L/R), the first package arrive, the second package in the last router, the third one in the penult router, and so on.
  When N*(L/R)+L/R, the second package arrive, the third in the last router. By the logic, we can tell when N*(L/R)(P-1)*(L/R)=(N+P-1)*(L/R), all package arrive.


P3
A.	Circuit-switched networks, because applications will run at steady rates for long periods of time, can retain bandwidth for them.
B.	No, the sum of the transmission rates is less than the link capacity.


P7 
Host A generate 56 bytes of grouping need 56*8b/62kbps=7ms
Delay =56 * 8b / 2Mbps = 0.224ms
Total =7ms+10ms+0.224ms=17.224ms
