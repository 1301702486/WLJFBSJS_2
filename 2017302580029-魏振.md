　　a.Solution:  
  
　　　　　The time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the highway is (10 cars)*(12 s/car) = 120 seconds
= 2 minutes. The time required for a car to travel from the exit of one tollbooth to the next tollbooth is 150 km/(100 km/hour)
= 1.5 hours = 90 minutes. Therefore, the time from when the caravan is stored in front of a tollbooth until the caravan is 
stored in front of the next tollbooth is (90 minutes) + (2 minutes) = 92 minutes. In this question, total time should contains 
the time when the caravan is stored in front of first tollbooth until the caravan is stored in front of second tollbooth, the 
time when the caravan is stored in front of second tollbooth until the caravanis stored in front of third tollbooth and the 
time required for the third tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the highway, that  

　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　92 minutes + 92 minutes + 2 minutes = 186 minutes    
  
　　b.Solution:  
  
　　　　　 In question b, we can just change the time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the highway to
(8 cars)*(12 s/car) = 1.6 minutes in question a. So the total time is  
  
　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　(90 minutes + 1.6 minutes)*2 + 1.6 minutes = 184.8 minutes

&emsp;&emsp;Solution: From the question we have the packet loss probability p, and each link is independent, so the probability  
that a packet is successfully received by the receiver is
