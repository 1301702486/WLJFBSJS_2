**P25**

a.

  d_prop = 20000km / (2.5\*10^8 m/s) = 0.08s
  
  R·d_prop = 2Mbps \* 0.08s = 1.6\*10^5 bits 
  
b. 

 The theoretical maximum of bits in the link is
 R·d_prop=1.6\*10^5.
 
 8\*10^5 bits \> 1.6\*10^5 bits ,
 
 so the bits of the given file can fill the link
 
 The maximum number of bits is 1.6\*10^5.
 
c.

  It is exactly the maximum number of bits that can be
  transported in the link.
  
d.

  2\*10^7 m / 1.6\*10^5 bits = 125m/bit
  
  The length of a standard football field is between 90m~120m.
  
  So the width of a bit is longer than a football field.
  
  
e.

  s/R

**P26**

 According to P25, solve the following formula:
 
 s/R=20000km
 
 The result is R=12.5 bps

**P27**

a.

  d_prop = 20000km / (2.5\*10^8 m/s) = 0.08s
  
  R·d_prop = 1Gbps \* 0.08s = 8\*10^7 bits 
  
b.

  The theoretical maximum of bits in the link is R·d_prop=8\*10^7.
  
  8\*10^5 bits < 8\*10^7 bits,
  
  so the bits can not fill the link.
  
  The maximum number of bits is 8\*10^5.
  
c.

 2\*10^7 m/ 8\*10^7 bits = 0.25m/bit,
 
 The width of a bit is 0.25m.
