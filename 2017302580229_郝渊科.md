# Assignment 2



## P29

​	The distance between the satellite and the earth is 36,000 km.

**a.** Propagation delay is:
$$
3.6*10^7/2.4*10^8=0.15\,sec
$$
**b.** Bandwidth-delay product:
$$
R_{dprop}=0.15\,sec\,*10^7\,bps=1.5*10^6\,bit
$$
**c.** Minimum size of photo:
$$
10^7\,bps*60\,sec=6*10^8\,bit
$$


## P31

**a.** From the source to the first switch:
$$
8*{10}^6\,bit/2*{10}^6\,bps=4sec
$$
​	Total time to move the message from source host to destination host:
$$
4\,sec*3\,hop=12sec
$$
**b.** Move the first packet from source host to the first switch:
$$
1*10^4\,bit/2*10^6\,bps=5\,msec
$$
​	The time the second packet is received by first switch is when the first packet is received by 	the second switch:
$$
5\,msec+1*10^4\,bit/2*10^6\,bps=10\,msec
$$
**c.** The first packet arrives at the destination host takes:
$$
5\,msec*3\,hop=15\,msec
$$
​	Then every $5\,msec$ a packet will be received by the destination host, so the total time is:
$$
15\,msec+799*5\,msec=4.01\,sec
$$
​	That's almost one-third of the time taken without segmentation.

**d.**

* Without segmentation, routers will have to allocate a large amount of  storage for huge packets, which will increase costs significantly.
* Also, transmission of small packets will be held up for rather long time (queuing),  transmitting capacity of subsequent routers will be wasted.   
* What's more, without segmentation,  the whole message has to be retransmitted if there is am error bit.

**e.**

* If one segmented packet is lost, then the whole message will not be read.
* Headers for each segmented packet ask for more transmitting bits.
* Dispatching and integrating are needed to reassemble the packets into a complete message.



## P33

​	The time taken to transmit the first packet to the destination host is:
$$
\frac{S+80}{R}*3\,sec
$$
​	Then every $\frac{S+80}{R}\,sec$ one of the  $\frac{F}{S}-1$ packet is received at the destination host.

​	Thus the total delay in sending the whole file is:
$$
\frac{S+80}{R}*(\frac{F}{S}+2)\,sec
$$
​	Let
$$
\frac{d}{dS}delay=0
$$
​	Then we get
$$
S=\sqrt{40F}
$$
