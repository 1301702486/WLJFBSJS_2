# Assignment 2
## P3
a. It will be better to use circuit-switched network.Because this application will continue running for a long period of time at a steady rate.
Therefore, the channel capacity won't be wasted and the circuit-switched network can transmit data faster and more stable,the time delay will also be reduced.

b. The network does not need congestion control, because one link has enough bandwidth to handle all of the application's data rates.

## P6
a. d<sub>prop</sub> = m/s

b. d<sub>trans</sub> = L/R

c. d<sub>delay</sub> = d<sub>prop</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub> = m/s + L/R

d. The last bit is exactly leaving host A.

e. The first bit is in the link between A and B.

f. The first bit has already arrived at host B.

g. d<sub>prop</sub> = m/s, d<sub>trans</sub> = L/R  
   m/(2.5 * 10^8^) = 120/(56 * 10^3^)  
   m = 5.36 * 10^5^ m = 536 km.

## P12
For one packet,the transmitting time is 1500 * 8 bits / 2 Mbps = 6 msec.  
There are 4.5 packets,so the total time is 6*4.5=27msec.  
Queuing delay is(L-x)/R+nL/R=[(n+1)*L-x]/R
